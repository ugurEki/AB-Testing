# Fast-Food Marketing Campaign A/B Testing

![A/B Text](ab-testing.png)

This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of three different marketing campaigns for promoting a new item on a fast-food chain's menu. The fast-food chain randomly selected several markets to introduce the new product, with each location using a different promotion strategy. The sales of the new item were recorded on a weekly basis for the first four weeks.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

* <b>MarketID:</b> A unique identifier for each market.
* <b>MarketSize:</b> Indicates the size of the market area based on sales.
* <b>LocationID:</b> A unique identifier for each store location.
* <b>AgeOfStore:</b> Represents the age of the store in years.
* <b>Promotion:</b> Specifies one of the three promotions that were tested.
* <b>Week:</b> Represents one of the four weeks when the promotions were run.
* <b>SalesInThousands:</b> Indicates the sales amount for a specific LocationID, Promotion, and Week.
 
## Goal

The goal of this project is to evaluate the A/B testing results and determine which marketing strategy had the greatest effect on sales. By analyzing the data, we aim to identify the most successful promotion and provide insights for the fast-food chain to make an informed decision regarding their marketing campaign.

## Analysis Steps

1. <b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</b> We will conduct initial exploratory analysis to understand the structure of the dataset, check for missing values, and gain insights into the distributions and relationships between variables.

2. <b>Statistical Analysis:</b> We will perform statistical tests, such as hypothesis testing, to compare the sales performance across different promotions and identify any significant differences.

3. <b>Visualization:</b> Visual representations, including charts and graphs, will be utilized to present the findings and patterns in the data effectively.

4. <b>Decision Making:</b> Based on the analysis and statistical results, we will make recommendations and conclusions about which promotion strategy worked best for driving sales.

## Conclusion

By analyzing the A/B testing results, we aim to determine the most effective marketing strategy for promoting the fast-food chain's new item. The findings form this project will provide valuable insights for the company's decision making process, allowing them to optimize their marketing compaigns and maximize sales.
